## Introduction

Many children face challenges in learning core concepts, particularly when it comes to subjects that require a strong foundation in logical thinking and problem-solving.

The app's gamified approach to learning helps motivate students and make learning enjoyable, while also providing teachers with tools to monitor and guide their students’ progress.
